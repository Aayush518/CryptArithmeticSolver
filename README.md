# CryptArithmetic Solver

CryptArithmetic Solver is a web application built with Flask that solves cryptarithmetic puzzles. Cryptarithmetic, also known as alphametics, is a type of mathematical puzzle where the digits of numbers are replaced by letters to form a valid equation.

## Features

- **Input Form**: Users can input three strings representing the words in the cryptarithmetic puzzle.
- **Solver**: The application solves the cryptarithmetic puzzle and displays the solutions along with solving statistics.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: The interface provides an intuitive way for users to input puzzles and view solutions.

## How to Use

1. **Access the Application**: Open the [CryptArithmetic Solver](https://cryptarithmeticsolver.onrender.com) in your web browser.

2. **Input Puzzle Strings**:
   - Enter three strings representing the words in the cryptarithmetic puzzle.
   - Each string corresponds to a word in the puzzle equation (e.g., "SEND", "MORE", "MONEY").

3. **Solve the Puzzle**:
   - Click the "Solve" button to submit the input and solve the cryptarithmetic puzzle.

4. **View Solutions**:
   - Once the puzzle is solved, the solutions and solving statistics will be displayed below the input form.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Programming language used for backend development.
- **Flask**: Web framework used for building the application.
- **Google OR-Tools**: Library used for solving cryptarithmetic puzzles.
- **HTML/CSS**: Frontend development for the user interface.
- **JavaScript**: Enhancing frontend interactivity and functionality.
